para-0000	Hello , Sir . So , you are back ?	Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit .	That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .
para-0001	What kind of place shall we rent ?	It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .	Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .	Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?	I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .	Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
para-0002	Let's play chess .	I haven't played chess for a long time .	That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play .	Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing .
para-0003	Excuse me . Do you have the time ?	My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think .	Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ?
para-0004	I give up ! I simply can't learn French !	Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress .	No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well .	Learning any language takes a lot of effort.But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ?
para-0005	It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession .	The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports .	Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .	It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy .
para-0006	Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby !	Really ? That's so great . Congratulations .	Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now .	That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ?	Three months .	Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ?	I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way .
para-0007	Good morning . My name is Mr . Brown . I ’ m from Australia . Here is my card .	Thank you . I ’ m pleased to meet you , Mr . Brown . My name is Kathy Pewless , the representative of Green Textile Import and Export Corporation .	Pleased to meet you too , Ms . Pewless . I travel a lot every year on business , but this is my first visit to your country . I must say I have been much impressed by your friendly people .	Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments .	Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ’ Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ’ Ve got some idea of your exports . I ’ m interested in your silk blouses .	Our silk is known for its good quality . It is one of our trade - trional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . They ’ Ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .
para-0008	Hello , thank you for calling Bradford and Sons . This is Tracy speaking , How may I help you ?	Hello . I would like to speak to your director of human resources , Ms.Jenkins , Please .

para-0009	How are the children doing at sport ?	I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age .	He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?	He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone his age .	Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?	The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .	How are they at swimming ?	They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .	Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
para-0010	Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements .	Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .	And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .
para-0011	Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ?	Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well .	Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .
para-0012	Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ?	Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ?	I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films .	Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary .
para-0013	I was wondering if you could help me with something .	Sure , anything you say .	Actually , it ’ s a little bit silly .	Don ’ t worry about it , just ask .	What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?	You need to know the type of shoes you want .	Don ’ t worry about that . I can point it out in the store .	The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .	Let me write all that down . I ’ m going shopping this afternoon .
para-0014	May I know where you are going ?	Yes . I want to go to Beijing Hotel .	I'm sorry . You are going in the wrong direction .	Oh no ! What shall I do ?	Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . The bus stop is right there .
para-0015	Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ?	Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ?	Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building .
para-0016	What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong .	What do you mean ?	Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way .
para-0017	Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ?	Sure ! What do you feel like having ?	I really feel like having a big juicy steak !	Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?	I didn't know you were a vegetarian !	I'm not , I am a vegan .	A what ?	A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .	Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !	It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
para-0018	Hey Stacy . What's going on ?	I'm pretty tired these days .	Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?	I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .	How about your husband . Does he help much ?	Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?	That sucks .	If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?
para-0019	Good evening , ma'am . Table for one ?	Yes , please .	Will this table be all right ?	Actually , I'd like a booth by the window if that's possible .	Certainly . How about this one ?	This will be fine , thanks .	( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order .
para-0020	Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments .	But I don't have any reading assignments .	Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep .
para-0021	I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday .	Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer .	You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ?	To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression .	But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive .
para-0022	I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past .	I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process .	And it takes up all the news .	The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .	It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .	Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .	I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .	Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .
para-0023	Hi , Jack , how have you been ?	Not very well .	Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?	Nothing .	Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter .	Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane .	Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .	Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .	Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family .
para-0024	I hear you are planning to travel abroad .	Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ?	In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles .	Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii .	Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight .	And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it .
para-0025	Do you want to hang out tomorrow ?	Oh , I can't . I have a date !	Really ? Wow with who ?	This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend .	Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?
para-0026	What game do you like ?	I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts .	I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated .	It ’ s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn .	I like playing cards . I ’ m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ?	I ’ m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ’ d lose all my money .	Do you play bridge ?	Yes , I do . It ’ s hard to find four players though , so I don ’ t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game .	I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ’ s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ?	Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .
para-0027	Thank you for lending me the book .	Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow .	But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones .
para-0028	Dave , there's something I want to talk to you about .	Zina , why are you whispering ?	I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship .	What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ?	Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince .	We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose .
para-0029	I need help using the washer and dryer .	Tell me what the problem is .	I can't figure out how to turn them on .	Do you have some quarters ?	I didn't know I needed change .	The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .	Where do I put the change ?	The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .
para-0030	What game do you like ?	I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts .	I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street .

OK , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms , Way Bills , Bills of Lading , Customs forms , various certificates .	OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ?	Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds .
para-0032	I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ?	Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .	I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .	Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?	I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .	You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ?	You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film .
para-0033	Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ?	We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock .	You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .	OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ?	I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .
para-0034	After the financial crisis , many industries are in incredibly cloudy situations . How do you think about our company ?	The outlook in the future is very positive .

para-0036	Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ?	I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them .	What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ?	Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend .	And your parents took it badly ?	That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her .	Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ?	She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away .
para-0037	Hi Jim . Do you have a minute ?	Sure , what ’ s up ?	Some of us are going to start a soccer team . Would you like to join us ?	I don ’ t know anything about it . Soccer isn ’ t as popular in my country as it is here .	That ’ s all right . We ’ ll teach you .	Is it anything like American football ?	Not very much . It ’ s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .	I ’ ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ’ s like .

It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you .
para-0041	I'm interested in Chinese antiques .	We have a great variety of Chinese antiques . Besides , we have landscape painting , figure painting and flower-and-bird painting .	I'd like a flower-and-bird painting .	How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty .	Oh , they look just like live cranes .

However , I would also consider a part-time position .	Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?	I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis .	What is your greatest strength ?	I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .	What is your greatest weakness ?	I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself .	Why do you want to work for our company ?	After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team .
para-0043	Have you seen the new James Bond movie ?	Oh , yes . You ?	Yes . What did you think of it ?	I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?	Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?

para-0077	I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past .	I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process .	And it takes up all the news .	The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .
para-0078	I need help using the washer and dryer .	Tell me what the problem is .	I can't figure out how to turn them on .	Do you have some quarters ?	I didn't know I needed change .	The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .

It's important to do proper exercises .	You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .	The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .	Sounds reasonable .	We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .

para-0083	have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?	sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .	as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?
para-0084	I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely !	No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering .	Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining .	Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ?	Actually , the factory is located in Scotland .	Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production	That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !	Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ...	Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection .
para-0085	Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one .	Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .	Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
para-0086	I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports .	It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight .	What about a draft at 120 days sight ?	All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .	A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .	Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
para-0087	Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ?	Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ?	Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ?	Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas .

I ’ d appreciate it if you would give me a chance .	All right , Maria . I ’ ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ’ ll have to re-do it .

para-0092	Excuse me , would you please do me a favor ?	With pleasure .	I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
para-0093	You still have not given me those files I ’ Ve asked you for .	I ’ m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ’ Ve just been so busy today .	I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up .	You ’ re right , sir . I apologize . I ’ ll get those files for you now .
para-0094	What's wrong with you ? You look pale .	I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold .	When did the trouble start ?	I was sick most of the night .	It sounds like you are coming down with the flu .

Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .	All right , thanks .	The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .	What shall I do today ?	I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .

You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?	Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !	Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
para-0096	My dear , what's for supper ?	Red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms .	What about soup ?	Sour-peppery soup .	Which condiment do you use for ?	I'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar .

Do you think you can speak English quite fluently ? Tell me about your English education .
para-0098	Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy .	I don ’ t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .	Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good .	No , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres .
para-0099	What did he say ?	He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .	It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man .	Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .
para-0100	I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday .	What words ? Can you tell me ?	He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .	Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .
para-0101	Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ?	Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ?	I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films .	Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary .	Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .	It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .	But it's really exciting .	Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .	Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .
para-0102	We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival .	When is it ?	It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month .	Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ?	OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
para-0103	This looks like a very nice house .	You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it .	The style of the exterior is just what I ’ Ve been looking for !	The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible .	This home is gorgeous on the inside !	Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .	The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .	Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .	I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .	The master suite is the best . Let ’ s go look at that next .
para-0104	I'd like to withdraw some money from my account .	Can I see your passbook and the withdrawal slip , please ?	Sure .	Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars ?

para-0107	Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ?	Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !	I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .	Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .
para-0108	I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me .	What did you argue about ?	He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet .	Well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair .	Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry .
para-0109	Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK .	Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious .	I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .	I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation .	It must have really hurt afterwards .	Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing .
para-0110	Is there anything wrong ?	I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college .	Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager .	I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything .	You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision .
para-0111	How are the children doing at sport ?	I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age .	He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?	He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone his age .	Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
para-0112	Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ?	I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ?	That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service .	A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ?	A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .	But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you .	We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
para-0113	Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names .	That's OK .	The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective .	Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared .
para-0114	hi , Bob , I am so glad that you came .	of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends .	yeah . It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .
para-0115	Do you have experience in advertising ?	Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company .	What were you mean duties there ?	I mostly did advertising planning .	What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?	I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .

Could you start the ball rolling ?
para-0117	Want to send out for some Chinese ?	Some what ?	Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .	No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?	Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .	Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?	Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .
para-0118	Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ?	I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ?	That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service .
para-0119	I hear you are expecting your family .	Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well .	I didn't know you had a brother .	Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often .	Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ?	His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here .	Does your brother have just one son ?	No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them .	I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .
para-0120	Have you seen the new James Bond movie ?	Oh , yes . You ?	Yes . What did you think of it ?	I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?	Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?	Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan .	Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?
para-0121	You are looking really healthy lately . What are you doing differently ?	Thank you for noticing ! I've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year .	Tell me about it . I'm interested .	Well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking .	Ha ! That's right . You used to smoke . I forgot !	When I kicked that habit , I found I had so much more energy . I started exercising .
para-0122	If only our company prescribe flex time .	The board has been considering introducing flex time .	Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided .
para-0123	That dress is very pretty . Why don ’ t you like it ?	It ’ s too loud .	We ’ Ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for ?	Well , you know , those styles or colors don ’ t suit me .	What style do you want ?	I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .
para-0124	Farmer's Pet Store .	Can you please tell me where you are located ?	Sure , we are off Singing Road , close to the bank .
para-0125	Ok , honey , time to take down the Christmas tree .	Do we have to ?	Come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging .	It ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere .	A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room .	But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ’ d really hate to have to take it down .	But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it .	I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .	But it ’ s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .	I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .
para-0126	I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports .	It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight .	What about a draft at 120 days sight ?	All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .
para-0127	Yes , madam ? Can I help you ?	Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ?	Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .	I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .	Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?	Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?	That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?	Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .	I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .	I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .	Well , it's all new stock in the window now .	May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?	Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .	Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .	Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .
para-0128	I've come to hear about your offer .	We have the offer ready for you . Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in June . The offer is valid for five days .	I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected .	You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .	I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .
para-0129	Here you are . You left the medicine here .	Sorry . I was too worried .	I firmly believe that you love your brother very much .	Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ?	Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold .
para-0130	The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !	Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .	That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !
para-0131	Come on , you are left behind !	Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey .	You just need more exercise .	Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing !	I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .	But running so fast is not good for people over forties .	Why ?	We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us .	But I want to burn up more calories !	In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .
para-0132	Tell me about yourself .	I was born and raised in Beijing . I attended Peking University and received my bachelor's degree in Economics . I have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co . Ltd .	What type of position are you looking for ?	I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience .	Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?	I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .
para-0133	Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ?	Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !	I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .	Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .
para-0134	Excuse me . I have an appointment with Mr . Li at nine . May I come in ?	Yes , come in please . I am Mr . Li . You must be My Liu , right ?	Yes , I am My Liu . Thanks .	I'd like to start this interview with some questions . Why do you think you are qualified for this position ?	According to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . I think my background meets the requirement of this position .	Then tell me something about your background .	My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language .	Well , what do you think about the development in computers ?	The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future .	Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ?	Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE .
para-0135	Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?	What ? Why do we have to do that ?	Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .	I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
para-0136	Ok , honey , time to take down the Christmas tree .	Do we have to ?	Come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging .	It ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere .	A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room .	But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ’ d really hate to have to take it down .	But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it .	I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .	But it ’ s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .	I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .	Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ’ t always be this good , but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should .	Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree .	I ’ ll make a deal with you . We ’ ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ’ ll take it down after church .
para-0137	I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me .	What did you argue about ?	He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet .	Well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair .	Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry .	Did you lend him a lot of money ?	Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .	Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?	No , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up .	Of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
para-0138	Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ?	Fine , thank you , and how are you ?	Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York .	Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you .	How are you getting along with your business ?	Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year .	I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance .
para-0139	What are you typing there ?	I'm working on my resume .	Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ?	Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet .

We need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations .	What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ?	Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat .
para-0142	I hear you are expecting your family .	Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well .	I didn't know you had a brother .	Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often .	Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ?	His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here .	Does your brother have just one son ?	No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them .	I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .
para-0143	Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ?	Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?	I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally .	If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?
para-0144	The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !	Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .	That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !	Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded .	I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
para-0145	Shall we share a taxi ?	Where are you heading now ?	I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road.It is very close to your house .
para-0146	I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ?	It's simple . You can use call transfer .	Is it so simple ?	Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls .	It's true .	Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call .
para-0147	You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game .	Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me !	Of course !

Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ?	That's the one .	You mean we'll share the taxi ?	Yeah.If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper.Besides that your Chinese is better than mine.The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully .
para-0149	hi , Bob , I am so glad that you came .	of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends .	yeah .

Maybe another time .	You could try the ravioli . They are rather like your Chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious .	Sounds good . I think I'll have the lamb for my main course . What does it come with ?	Well , you can have fries-French fries-or simple boiled potatoes .	I'll have the potatoes . What are you having ?	I'm having my usual . I like the fish here . Would you like some wine ?

I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .
para-0153	Ms . Montgomery ? This is Richard Thomas . I ’ m sorry to bother you at home , but I ’ Ve got a bit of a problem .	Oh ? What ’ s wrong ?	My daughter ’ s just banged up her knee pretty badly and I ’ m going to have to take her to the hospital . I ’ ll be about two hours late .

Neither of us is very religious .	Which hotel will the reception be held at ?	The palace hotel they ’ re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ’ m sure they ’ ll do a good job .	Oh , yes . It ’ s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .	Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .

We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales .
