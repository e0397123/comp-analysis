ddpc-0002	Good afternoon , Johnson .	I'm not feeling well . I'm very nervous .
ddpc-0003	You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work .	I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .	Do you feel ok ?	Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .	Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .	Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?	You're really hot .

Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .	Shouldn't we make an appointment first ?	Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up.Can you wash my windows for me ?

ddpc-0009	This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing !	It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ’ m going to take a dip .	Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke !	I get too tired ! I ’ ll just backstroke , it ’ s easier !	Try kicking your legs more . That ’ s good . Don ’ t go out too far !	It ’ s fine . Jump in !	are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?
ddpc-0010	So , Paula , where are you from ?	I'm from Canada , originally .	From Canada ? Where were you born ?	Montreal .	When did you come to Los Angeles ?	We moved here when I was fourteen .	Did you go to school here ?	Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas .	Did you get a job right after graduation ?	No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France .	When was that ?	I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?
ddpc-0011	That looks graceful on you .	Thank you.But it is too bright for me .	How about this brown one ?	Let me try it on . I like that color .	Ok , i will get one for your.Here you are .	But it is too loose.Do you have the smaller size ?	What a pity !
ddpc-0012	Bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ?	Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ?	Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else .	That'd be wonderful , Peter .

How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?	great , let's go !	hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .	exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...	why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
ddpc-0019	Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ?	Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !	I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .	It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
ddpc-0020	We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center .	That's great .	This is your luggage check Which You must show when you disembark at your destination and here is your boarding pass and your ticket .

ddpc-0022	Room service , is there anything I can do for you ?	Yes , I am afraid there are not enough outlets .	Yes , but 4 of them are broken . Can you send someone here ?

ddpc-0026	have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning ?	it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ?
ddpc-0027	Look , how grand magnificent the Tiananmen Gate tour is !	What's Tiananmen famous for ?	It is largest pop square in the world.you see that is monument for the people's hero , and the Chairman Mao memorial hall on the south.there is great hall of the people on the west.there are two museums on the east .	That's the Forbidden city on the north of Gate building .
ddpc-0028	Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?	I'd love to , the movies are smash hit .	Then let's go in .	I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late .	I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .	I know . I wonder what's keeping him .	Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ?	Yeah , a number of times .	What's he trying to pull anyway .	Of course . I've loved writing since I was a very little boy . I won the first prize in a national composition contest when I was in middle school . After attending Nanjing University , I never give up writing . My works , such as Father's Tobacco Pipe , Open Air Cinema , The old City were respectively published China Youth Daily , Yangzi Evening News , and New Beijing . During the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , I paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . The Impact of Internet in Chinese Political Participation , The Discipline of Remold , The Historical Direction of Chinese Administration Reform , Bribery Cases of Self governance in Chinese Villages are respectively published in Chinese Publish Administration , Beijing Due Xuebao , Theory and Society and Chinese Reform . I joined in Yangzi Evening News to work as a part-time journalist in 2006 . During this period , I've written a lot of comments , which improved my writing ability to a new level , I have full confidence in my writing ability , and I believe I can do the job well .
ddpc-0029	Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ?	Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume .	But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ?	Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume .	Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .
ddpc-0030	Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ?	No , we don't .	How many of you , please ?	No .

ddpc-0042	Have you ever tried shopping online ?	No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes .	I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .
ddpc-0043	May I see your passport , please ?	Certainly . Here it is .	You are here on business , I think ?	That's right . A German company has invited me for business talks .

That's too expensive for me .	This television is of very high quality .	You can't go down on the price .	By how much ?	I'm sorry , but the price is final .
ddpc-0045	I'm a little nervous .	Don't worry . You'll be fine . First of all , put on your seat belt . Adjust the mirrors .	You don't think I'll need the seat belt , do you ?	Of course not . But it's a good habit to put it on every time you drive .	Just in case , right ?	It means that we will arrive on the same day .
ddpc-0046	Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names .	That's OK .	The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective .	Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared .	Thank you .	Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time .	That's a good idea .	First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract .	For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments .
ddpc-0047	Can I have the window seat over there ?	Sorry , sir . That table has been booked .	Thank you very much .
ddpc-0048	Did you pack this bag yourself ? Has it been out of your possession at any time before checking-in ?	Yes , I packed it myself , and it hasn ’ t been out of my possession .

Let me see .	Promise that you won't get angry .	OK , I promise . What is it ?	I will . Thank you , Mummy .

No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern .
ddpc-0057	That looks graceful on you .	Thank you.But it is too bright for me .	How about this brown one ?	Let me try it on . I like that color .	Ok , i will get one for your.Here you are .	But it is too loose.Do you have the smaller size ?	Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish .
ddpc-0058	Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ?	Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth .

How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ?	it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait .	can I buy stamps here ?	sure . How many would you like ?	I did , but he wasn't able to either .
ddpc-0060	It's too hot to read .	We'd better go out for a walk .	The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .

ddpc-0063	What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring .	What kind of watch is it ?
ddpc-0064	Are you going to vote ?	Of course ! Are you ?	I plan to , but what day is the election ?	You should know that .	Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ?
ddpc-0065	Hi , Becky , what's up ?	Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .	What's the problem ?	Some what ?
ddpc-0066	Hello , ma ’ am , can I help you find something ?	No you ’ re not ! There are some right here !

ddpc-0068	Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific !	Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that .	That's pretty easy to explain .

ddpc-0070	What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps .	I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn .	Calm down ! Shouting won ’ t help ?	He is really outrageous .	What happened ?	I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me .	What ?

You can't be serious !	Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .	After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .	Whatever you say !
ddpc-0081	Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ?	Harry Potter .	Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ?	Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny .	Got it .	Have you ever read this book before ?	No , but my little brother likes it very much .	It's really a good book . You will like it too .	I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much .	Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ?

ddpc-0083	What are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ?	It's Beethoven . Do you like it ?	I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ?	I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax .	What other kind of music do you listen to ?	Actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ?	To be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me .	What kind of music do you prefer then ?	I like pop music . Do you ?	Not really . I don't think pop music has much depth .	I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much .	How long have you been in to pop music , then ?	I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ?	Not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all .	So , how did you become interested in it ?	It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly .
ddpc-0084	Would you check the engine , please ? It is knocking .	Sure . Do you want to have the car washed ?	Yes , please . When can you get it done ?	You can pick it up in half an hour . By the way , how are you going to pay , cash or credit ?	Are there any beds vacant ?

Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true !	Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists .	Let me see ...

ddpc-0188	You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ?	He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ?	I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .	I can think of better things to dream about ...	Which anti-virus program would you recommend ?

All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .	That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics .

I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .	do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?

Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .	I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much .

ddpc-0213	Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ?	You really should go to Rachel's pet store .	Why ? anything special there ?	It's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .	Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?	Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .	That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .	Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?	Why not ? it's so cool .	But it will pose a risk to your health .	Pardon ?	I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .	Well , I didn't realize that .	I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .	Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .	I need to buy some flowers for my wife .
ddpc-0214	Could you show me what you've got ?	We've got several good chicken dishes if you like chicken .	This is worth trying .

No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .	Really ?	Yes , it's just a couple of screws .	That's nice .	It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .	I can't understand him anyway .

It's important to do proper exercises .	You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .	The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .	We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
ddpc-0232	I'm sorry I'm late .	I have a sore throat and headache .
ddpc-0233	John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year .	I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska .	You can't be serious !	Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .

I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience .	Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?	I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .	Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?	I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis .	What is your greatest strength ?	I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .	What is your greatest weakness ?	I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself .	Why do you want to work for our company ?	I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great

I think my arm is broken .	Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .	Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .	Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .	I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?	Alright .	It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .	Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .	Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .	Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .	It really hurts .	Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?	To hell with you . The accident was your fault .	To hell with you .

Hey , listen .

I think my arm is broken .	Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .	Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .	Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .	I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?	Alright .	It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .	Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .	Damn it ! I'm injured here .

I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview .

ddpc-0552	So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...	No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .	Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments .
ddpc-0553	I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front .	What a wonderful neighborhood ! Can you find that house on our Open House list ?

ddpc-0556	Mary and Tom are breaking up .	He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . Are you willing to study hard ?
ddpc-0557	So , Paula , where are you from ?	I'm from Canada , originally .	From Canada ? Where were you born ?	Montreal .	When did you come to Los Angeles ?	We moved here when I was fourteen .	Did you go to school here ?	Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas .	Did you get a job right after graduation ?	No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France .	When was that ?	The fee is 25 cents every day .
ddpc-0558	Should we tip ? This service is pretty good .	Yeah , we probably should.How much is normal ?	That sounds about right .
ddpc-0559	Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ?	Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ?	Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .	That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems .	Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .
ddpc-0560	What can I show you ?	Do you have this shirt in a small ?	Let me check . Yes , we have .	May I try it on ?	What dressing would you like on the salad ?

ddpc-0565	Matthew ? Hi !	Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ?	It's got to be almost a year now .	How have you been ?	I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .	Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?	Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck .	Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look .

ddpc-0568	Can you tell me where the pots and pans are ?	Pots and pans are right over there .	Oh , thank you .	Could I interest you in our store credit card ?	No , thanks . I already have credit cards .	But our credit card saves you 10 percent .	That's a nice discount .	The outlook in the future is very positive . Because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely .
ddpc-0569	John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year .	I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska .	You can't be serious !	Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .	After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .	Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .	I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
ddpc-0570	hi , Lander . What's wrong ?	I can hardly make ends meet these days .	same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .	my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .	true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .	definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .	the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .	is that inflation ?	inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .	has the government taken some measures to curb it ?	yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .	but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .	you said it .

ddpc-0677	Good afternoon . Can I be of service ?	I don't know . Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter ?	Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available .	Two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 RIB .	I love it . It's so festive ! And where did you get that cup ? It's got the same logo .
ddpc-0678	Now , what seems to be the trouble ?	It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning .	Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ?	Yes , I never seem to have any energy .	Tomorrow morning ? What about tomorrow afternoon ?
ddpc-0679	What's wrong with you , young man ?	Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache .	Do you have a fever ?	I don't know , but I feel terrible .	Let me examine you . Don't worry . It's nothing serious .	What a miser ! He cycles to school every day .
ddpc-0680	Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city .	OK , please .	How old are your children ?
ddpc-0681	What game do you like ?	I am looking for an article in a newspaper .
ddpc-0682	Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ?	Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !	I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .	Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average .
ddpc-0683	How do you feel about that restaurant ?	It wasn't all that great .	Yeah . I totally forgot they were due .
ddpc-0684	Good afternoon , how may I help you ?	Hi , I'd like to order some flowers .	Who are they for ?	They're for my Wife . Her name is Samantha .	What kind of flowers would you like ?	I don't know . I don't know too much about flowers . Can you recommend something ?	OK . What's the reason you are sending her flowers ?	I think red would be nice .
ddpc-0685	What time is our connecting flight ?	Let me check.Oh , oh ! It ’ s at 3:25 .	Wow , that's cutting it close ! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! What gate is it at ?	It ’ s at ... gate 14 .	Oh , great ! That ’ s at the other end of the terminal !	I ’ m be right behind ya !
ddpc-0686	Hey Stacy . What's going on ?	I'm pretty tired these days .	Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?	I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .	How about your husband . Does he help much ?	If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?
ddpc-0687	How silly of you to jump out of the window !	But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake !	Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .	That would be too late .	Maybe the situation is too urgent .	Should we tip ? This service is pretty good .
ddpc-0688	I was wondering if you could help me with something .	Sure , anything you say .	Actually , it ’ s a little bit silly .	Don ’ t worry about it , just ask .	What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?	You need to know the type of shoes you want .	Don ’ t worry about that . I can point it out in the store .	The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .	perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .
ddpc-0689	So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...	No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .	Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line .
ddpc-0690	There's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ?	I haven't seen her yet .	I think that she is very pretty .	Tell me how she looks .	She's kind of short .	What height is she ?	Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?
ddpc-0691	John , I ’ d like you to meet Charles Brown , our new manager at the airport .	Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ?	He is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair .	Is there anything else ?	He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion .	How old is he ?	He is in his late thirties .	Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ?	Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing .
ddpc-0692	What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps .	I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .	come on , nothing can be that bad .	but promise me , you'll keep it a secret .	ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?	I've fallen in love with my boss .	really ? Is he married ?	no , of course not . He is still single .	then what's your problem ?	I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .	oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .	It ’ s nice meeting you .
ddpc-0693	did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ?	why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that .	well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers .	do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?	no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .	it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .	religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .	what do you think about abortion ?	I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .	do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?	why not ? It's their children , too .
ddpc-0694	Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ’ s been such a long time !	Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair !	Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret !	Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated !	Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know .	He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course !	Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently .	Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended .	Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday !	But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going .	Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !	That would be great ! Give me a call !	I can tell form the way he spoke to us .
ddpc-0695	What is life ?	Then do you think that life is arranged by something above us .
ddpc-0696	I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes .	I'm ready when you are , sir .	Very good ! Now , it's still morning here in New York .	You are so right , sir . The clock just struck nine .	I'm going to spend some time exploring the city . What can I do with my luggage ?	Sir , right here we have a storage site . Its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit .	I'm sorry , sir , but it isn't . Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely .
ddpc-0697	Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ?	Where did you learn it ?
ddpc-0698	How's Jimmy today ?	Better , thank you , doctor .	Can I see him please , Mrs Williams ?	Certainly , doctor . Come upstairs .	You look very well , Jimmy . You are better now , but you mustn't get up yet.You must stay in bed for another two days.The boy mustn't go to school yet , Mrs Williams . And he mustn't eat rich food .	Does he have a temperature , doctor ?	No , he doesn ’ t .	Must he stay in bed ?	Yes . He must remain in bed for another two days . He can get up for about two hours each day , but you must keep the room warm . Where's Mr Williams this evening ?	Yeah , so are you planning on going ?
ddpc-0699	Hello ! This is Ruby speaking from G . O . T . International Travel Agency . What can I do for you ?	I ’ d like to make a reservation for my trip from Detroit to Beijing on April 13 on Trans Pacific Airline .	Do you want a single ticket or a round trip ticket ?	I ’ d like to have a round trip ticket with a one-year open return .	Economy or Business Class ?	Economy , please . How much is it ?	We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival .
ddpc-0700	Hi , I'm George . I'll be your waiter this evening . Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes ?	I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .	You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ?
ddpc-0701	Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?	Sorry , I thought you knew .	But you should tell me you were in love with her .	Yes . it is I can teach you if you like .
ddpc-0702	Hello , ma ’ am , can I help you find something ?	Yes , actually I ’ m looking to buy a camera .	We ’ Ve got a wide selection do you know if you ’ d like a point-and-shoot , or something a little fancier ? Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else ?

This here is the .	The Canon Eos . Yeah it ’ s ok , but I ’ m looking for something that performs better in low light , has a better display panel , and longer battery life .	Oh , ah , um the Nikon D60 is a nice option .	Yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? I don ’ t want some bulky telephoto lens .	Oh , well this one has the , uh .	Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !	So , ahem , can I interest you in any acc ...	Accessories ? Do you carry polarizing filters ?	Thank you .

I'm sure . You have the wrong number . I have used this number for more than 20 years .	That can't be true . I remember the number clearly . Is your number 1199886 ?	Please , just call me Tom .
ddpc-0707	Ok , honey , time to take down the Christmas tree .	Do we have to ?	Come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging .	It ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere .	A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room .	But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ’ d really hate to have to take it down .	But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it .	I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .	I'm sorry I'm late .
ddpc-0708	Where to , ma'am ?	But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
ddpc-0709	Hello , Parker . How ’ s everything ?	Can ’ t complain . And you ?	Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How ’ s your schedule looking ?	not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours .
ddpc-0710	They ’ ll do the operation for you this Friday .	But Saturday is my birthday .	I think it ’ s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital .	But your health is more important . Believe me !
ddpc-0711	Hello , I want to apply for the position of an usher in your restaurant .	Welcome . One of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation .	What else do I need to do ?	That's too bad . How much is a new one ?
ddpc-0712	I want some cosmetics.Could you recommend some ?	I think Pond's is the best .	And they're very dear , too .	Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
ddpc-0713	That way they look longer .	Now what are you doing ?	Putting on mascara .	I won't .
ddpc-0714	I'm very sorry , sir . My car has broken down .	Then I have to call another taxi , or I'll be late .
ddpc-0715	Let's have seafood for a change.How about oyster and lobster ?	I couldn't agree more !	Sure that ’ s fine . Here is the list of all the things you need to get . Don't forget anything ! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ?

ddpc-0722	Has Robert ever missed coming to one of our parties ?	Only once or twice at the most .	Do you know why ?	Excuse me , would you please do me a favor ?
ddpc-0723	Hi , Becky , what's up ?	Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .	What's the problem ?	Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .

What other kind of music do you listen to ?	Actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ?	To be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me .	What kind of music do you prefer then ?	I like pop music . Do you ?	Not really . I don't think pop music has much depth .	I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much .	How long have you been in to pop music , then ?	I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ?	Not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all .	So , how did you become interested in it ?	Yes , it's one of my hobbies .
ddpc-0727	Room service.What can I do for you ?	This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning .	Well , let me check for you . I am sorry , sir . They mistook your order as a normal one.Actualty it's an express laundry , is that right ?	Yes , I ordered the express service .	Oh . Well , it can't be helped .

ddpc-0734	John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year .	I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska .	You can't be serious !	Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .	After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .	What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ?

Well , we have a lot of models here.Did you want to listen to CD's or cassettes or the radio ?	Mostly cassette tapes .	Alright . There are several models you may want to look at.This Kreng portable cassette player is very good .	Kreng ? I've never heard of that company .	It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone .	I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily .	Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ?	How much is it ?
ddpc-0740	Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ?	I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning .
ddpc-0741	Office Supplies , Inc . Robert speaking , may I help you ?	How long have you been in England ?

ddpc-0744	What's the matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days .	Is your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high .	And what's the cause of that ?	Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down .	But I can't just slow down .	You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size .	You mean I've got to lose weight ?	Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ?
ddpc-0745	My son came home from three years in the navy .	It was a real red letter day for you .	Almost two years ? Your English is very good .
ddpc-0746	Hello , ma ’ am , can I help you find something ?	Yes , actually I ’ m looking to buy a camera .

Do you carry polarizing filters ?	No you ’ re not ! There are some right here !
ddpc-0747	Hello , Sir . So , you are back ?	Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit .	That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .	I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .
ddpc-0748	You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ?	He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ?	I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .	I can think of better things to dream about ...	That's crazy .
ddpc-0749	Where are you going ?	I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of
ddpc-0750	hi , Lander . What's wrong ?	I can hardly make ends meet these days .	same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .	my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .	true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .	definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .	the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .	is that inflation ?	inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .	has the government taken some measures to curb it ?	yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .	but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .	you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .	how ?	sounds a good idea .
ddpc-0751	Did you hear about the robbery ?	Are you serious ?
ddpc-0752	Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?	I'd love to , the movies are smash hit .	Then let's go in .	I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late .	I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .	I know . I wonder what's keeping him .	Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ?	Yeah , a number of times .	What's he trying to pull anyway .	Maybe you should start seeing someone else .
ddpc-0753	Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere .	Honey , the house is such a mess ! I need you to help me tidy up a bit . My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless !

ddpc-0757	I can ’ t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking .	How many chances have I given you ? I don ’ t trust you any more .
ddpc-0758	I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ?	I'd be glad to .	I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country .

Call transfer has many other advantages .

When we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken .	Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .
ddpc-0851	What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable .	It's us .	What do you mean by " us " ?	Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ?	Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .

ddpc-0854	Room service , is there anything I can do for you ?	Yes , I am afraid there are not enough outlets .	Me too .
ddpc-0855	May I see your ticket and passport , PLS ?	Sure , here they are .	Any luggage ?	Just this suitcase .	Your backpack is very big and today's flight is quite full . I am afraid that you will have to check your backpack too .	No problem . What about this carry-on ?	Actually you can have a window seat if you don't mind a ten-minute wait .
ddpc-0856	Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough .	What's wrong with it ?
ddpc-0857	Hello .	Can I borrow this magazine from you ? It's really interesting and I can't put it down .
ddpc-0858	How smart of you to book the tickets before hand !	Congratulations . What did you do during the interview ?
ddpc-0859	the James ’ s file , Christine ?	I had it right here a minute ago , Mr . Emory . Umm . Just a minute ...	Yes , sir . I apologize for that . Here ’ s the file you were looking for , Mr . Emory .
ddpc-0860	Excuse me , are you Mrs . Green from England ?	Yes , I am .	I'm pleased to meet you , Mrs . Green . My name is Myra . I work in Beijing Institute of Technology . I came here to meet you .	Are you ready for the camping trip ?
ddpc-0861	You still have not given me those files I ’ Ve asked you for .	I ’ m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ’ Ve just been so busy today .	I must be going .
ddpc-0862	Can I help you ?	Yes , I would like to buy a Walkman . Can you tell me about the models you have ?	Well , we have a lot of models here.Did you want to listen to CD's or cassettes or the radio ?	Mostly cassette tapes .	Alright . There are several models you may want to look at.This Kreng portable cassette player is very good .	Kreng ? I've never heard of that company .	It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone .	I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily .	Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ?	Not really . I could take it or leave it .
ddpc-0863	Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ?	Yeah , but have you made an appointment ahead ?	You ’ re welcome .
ddpc-0864	Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO .	I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again .	Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad .	Do you play much tennis ?
ddpc-0865	Hi . I need to have my shoes repaired .	What ’ s the matter with them ?	So , this 500 RIB is worthless ?
ddpc-0866	Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work .	I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in .	Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client .	I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman .	It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale .	Good afternoon ! Trans Pacific Airline . How can I help you ?
ddpc-0867	Hello , Parker . How ’ s everything ?	Can ’ t complain . And you ?	Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How ’ s your schedule looking ?	Great .

Another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea .
ddpc-0870	Hello . This is Mrs . Wilson . I'd like to buy a new car . Could you offer me a new type of the car , please ?	Oh , Madam , buy what ?	A new car .

It's Mike's Sporting Goods .	And after church they come here for lunch ?
ddpc-0871	Over here is our gym . We have all the latest equipment .	But I haven't used exercising equipment before . Can you tell us some more details ?	Certainly .

ddpc-0873	Can we choose a time to look at houses together ?	Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?	Either way is good for me .	There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ?	I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also .	We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home .	I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at .	I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day .	When I have confirmed the times with the owners , I will e-mail you our plans for the day .

ddpc-0885	Are these the clothes you want to have washed ?	Yes . When can I get them back ?	Well , if they are collected right now , you can get them back tonight .	No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern .

ddpc-0893	Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ?	Yeah , but have you made an appointment ahead ?	I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
ddpc-0894	I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods .	I know what you mean . I've started eating better myself .	What foods do you eat now ?	I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken .	Those are the only things you eat ?	That's basically what I eat .	Nothing particular . But , ...
ddpc-0895	Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don ’ t believe you are listening at all .	Don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well .
