order_shuffle_06	human: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.	model: Oh hello. Long time no talk. How's the day going for yuo?	human: Hi!	model: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine.

Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..	human: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too.

Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?	human: Are you doing any home decorating then?	model: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?	human: Hi!	model: Very well, thanks for asking. How has your day been?	human: Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.	model: I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.	human: Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.	model: Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?	human: I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?	model: Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.	human: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.

order_shuffle_15	human: Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?	model: Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?	human: I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?	model: I'm not much of a gamer but it's something I'd like to get into.	human: Hi! Sorry for the late response. How are you doing?	model: Hi!	human: What do you do in your free time?	model: I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise	human: I like to read for fun. I just finished a book called Temeraire. It's an adventure story set in the Napoleonic navy, like Patrick O'Brien, except there are dragons too.	model: I just got a matcha latte :) Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity	human: I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?	model: What's the most recent good thing you read?	human: Oh cool! I read a lot for fun too :) My favorite genre is sci-fi fantasy.

order_shuffle_16	human: Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.	model: Hi	human: True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.	model: Sure, whats the scenario?	human: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.	model: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.	human: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.	model: That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.	human: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;)	model: Lol. I'm finna be single.	human: Hi!	model: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?	human: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.

order_shuffle_17	human: Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?	model: Hi!	human: Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory.

Does that make sense so far?	human: The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.	model: yes	human: Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?	model: hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?	human: I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?	model: Do you have a favourite flower?	human: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila	model: Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.	human: Hello

order_shuffle_21	human: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?	model: 1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on :) What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)	human: Thats great! This is valuable help for the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity. 	model: Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)	human: That is actually a quote stolen from my TL when i joined my first company after graduation. I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it :)	model: I normally don't reflect back too much on things, but i guess 2019 have been very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and work life balance. Why do you ask?	human:  1) The idea of what it must be like to be "on Earth as it is in Heaven" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music	model: I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :)	human: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.	model: Hi!	human: Nice! That's very thoughtful and spiritual :) Also music earned a spot :) yay!	model: I think if we were all able to bring out our best selves, the world would be much better. When did you first realize mental health was important?	human: We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort. 	model: What was the most difficult thing you experienced this past year?	human: What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things?

Do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times?	model: Hi!	human: Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down.
