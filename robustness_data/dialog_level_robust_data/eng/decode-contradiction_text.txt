I might consider going vegetarian, it's just skipping meat.	human: It might not be easy at first but there are many interesting veggie options out there. 	chatbot: What interests me is veggie versions of meat products. I really want to try the impossible whopper.	human: I've never tried that one but it sounds yummy	chatbot: I've heard it's really good and that it tastes and looks just like real meat.	human: That sounds interesting, but I prefer real meat, so it doesn't sound too tasty to me.

I'm a little bit jealous myself.  	human: Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!	chatbot: It's amazing the effect something so seemingly small,  like the company headquarters opening,  can effect an entire town like that	human: Wish something like that could happen to us, right?	chatbot: No. It's terrible, and it would gentrify our neighborhood.

Losing two family members in such a short timespan is really heartbreaking. 	chatbot: its really heart breaking. i'm so glad to have made good memories. it would be tragic if i had regrets	human: I completely agree. It makes you realize how important it is to spend time with people while they are here.	chatbot: Absolutely, it's a chapter of your life and as long as you have those memories they live on through those memories.	human: That is a really good way of looking at it. And you can share those memories with new people in your life and breathe life into them.	chatbot: You are so right. It can make all the difference.	human: Do you have other family members to help you after your loss?	chatbot: yeah we have a large close knit family. how bout you?	human: Eh, my family is not really close.	chatbot: Yeah, mine either.

Irish was lower-class back in the day, just Ireland, a single sovereign state is how we regarded it.	human: I think a large part of the world still considers the Irish lower-class. Dublin is thought of as dirty. Neighboring countries do not get that rap.	chatbot: Could be.

contradiction-00	human: One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.	chatbot: I know,  that actually happens to me sometimes! Last year I didn't get accepted into this fellowship and for a couple of weeks I was underestimating myself a lot.	human: That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person,  though,  that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.	chatbot: Yea for sure,  I definitely learned that sometimes life just works in a funny way.

To my surprise though,  I've recently found her snuggling with the others she usually tries to fight!	chatbot: Im glad it worked out well. I bet your finally content with her being around other rats. 	human: I sure am! It was difficult, but quite rearding.	chatbot: I can believe that the rat doesn't belong other rats yet.

contradiction-00	human: I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.	chatbot: Oh no! I hate speaking in front of crowds.

contradiction-00	human: Look,  can we just be honest with each other for a second? Having ebola shouldn't mean that I have to be grounded and miss out on my chance to walk on the moon during the upcoming lunar missions.	chatbot: Okay,  well if you have it then you would have to see a doctor.	human: I saw one,  and he said if I gave him $25, 000 he would clear me for flight,  but I don't have that kind of money just lying around. It's a real bummer. Now I just have to do super boring NASA desk work like tracking comets. Lame.	chatbot: Now that is interesting,  I wish you the best of luck.	human: Why would I have to see a doctor just because I have ebola?	chatbot: Well, you don't have to; ebola's like the stomach flu.
contradiction-00	human: Do you enjoy watching cheerleading? 	chatbot: yes i do because it is an event where cheer cheerleaders cheer  for their team as a form of encouragement.	human: Cheerleaders have to be pretty good athletes themselves. Many of them do all kinds of stunts!	chatbot: Yes the activities can be chanting of  slogans to intense physical activity.	human: There are all sorts of national competitions for cheerleading as well. It has really changed a lot since I was a cheerleader years ago!	chatbot: oh yea?, well when such events occur, then there need to be cheerleaders to  to motivate sports teams, entertain the audience. 	human: That's true! Cheerleading is very popular here in the US. Thousands of kids participate, mostly girls but some boys too. 	chatbot: it seems so cool. i've never seen cheerleaders cheer in real life though.	human: me neither. I've always wanted to be one.
contradiction-00	human: care to chat with a hs teacher , who goes to church every week ?	chatbot: sure , what is your favorite color ?	human: pink is my favorite color , but that may be because i'm a female .	chatbot: i love red , reminds me of summer time .	human: summer is great . walking outside and gardening is what i enjoy .	chatbot: i prefer colder weather like winter	human: not me . neither does my dog that i've .	chatbot: that's funny , i do not get along with my wife	human: i might be able to relate to your wife , since we are both women .	chatbot: Yeah something about me must just rub some women the wrong way.	human: Don't say that be optimistic after all us guys have to stick together.

I thought they were jump similar foods.	human: No way!!! I would have never guessed! Hey, do you know where the hot dog originated?	chatbot: I know that they were originally imported from Germany and then became popular in the US. 	human: Figures, I don't care for German food, so that must be why I don't like hot dogs.	chatbot: I love hot dogs. I don't like putting on a lot of extra stuff because it covers the natural flavor, just a bit of mustard works for me.

contradiction-00	human: There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do,  as I feel it's my part to help those in need,  as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.	chatbot: I don't think you should feel too bad about missing one day!  It sounds like you're generous regularly.  I get it though.	human: Well,  homeless people aren't common in my area,  so that's why I felt a bit bad about it. 	chatbot: It's hard to see people and not be able to help.  You seem really giving!	human: I certainly try to be.  It's what Jesus would do.	chatbot: Too bad you're so stingy you could help the man out.

I got a Yamaha motorcycle. It's not Harley, but it works	chatbot: I have a Toyota Camry.

contradiction-00	human: I was out at dinner with my family,  and when coming back to the table from the bathroom I somehow accidentally sat down with a different family.	chatbot: That is embarassing,  but a good story at least!	human: Yeah,  it certainly lead to a lot of good natured ribbing from my parents :P	chatbot: That is for sure,  you can always count on parents for that	human: My boyfriend is the one that directed me to the wrong table.	chatbot: I'm sure it wasn't embarrassing. I've done way worse.

New experiences are always good.	human: I could do that, and surprise her with my new skill when she comes home.	chatbot: I'm sure she'll love it! What type of books are you into?	human: Mysteries mostly.  You?	chatbot: I love mysteries, but lately I've been reading the Berenstain Bears books, at the insistence of my child! They're illustrated children's novels like those in the 	human: My children love those.  Such good lessons in each.	chatbot: I agree, the mysteries are great! It's also nice how the author can either stick to facts or be highly speculative. Makes for some varied reading.	human: Very true, however I believe technology has ruined the modern mystery,	chatbot: How do you think technology has ruined the modern mystery?	human: much less leg work and creative thinking.  	chatbot: That's true. But I still think technology helped in some ways also.	human: I'm so happy my wife won't be available this weekend, I'd get to do things I've been wanting to do.

contradiction-00	human: I can remember feeling so disillusioned when someone who I really admired as a visionary turned out to be a real jerk on a day-to-day basis.	chatbot: That can really make you lose your faith in wanting to trust people	human: Well,  it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal. Not really fair to them *or* to yourself,  is it?	chatbot: No not really because we are all human and make mistakes.	human: I guess, I have never really been disappointed by someone before.
contradiction-00	human: I love American Football!  I actually was a football player in college. Obviously the team with the most points at the end wins!	chatbot: I don't enjoy sports too much, and it's difficult to enjoy American football these days with all of the political issues.	human: That's true about the NFL.  College football is actually how American Football rules first gained popularity in the US	chatbot: I didn't know that. Frankly, the only difference I'm aware of between the NFL and college football is that College players don't get paid.	human: That's true.  College football is generally thought of as 2nd tier American football - one step ahead of High School but a step below professional. 	chatbot: They must be pretty good though. There are video games based upon some teams. I know people bet on games too using online draft picks. Whatever THAT means haha	human: And Football can actually be traced to early versions of rugby and association football.  Video games are insane.

contradiction-00	human: I actually used to cheerlead for a while in high school.  It is a lot harder than it looks	chatbot: I agree 100 percent. Cheerleading not only includes chanting slogans but involves lots of physical activity.	human: Yes, and a lot of people do not know how dangerous it can be.  Not just the normal wear and tear, but injuries can be pretty bad	chatbot: Chearleading is very strenuous. Especially now that it also considered a competitive sport in itself. Routines range from one to three minutes. The routines contain lots of tumbling and jumps.	human: One of the major reasons of injuries is from stunting, otherwise known as the pyramid	chatbot: That is a difficult move. I love how in 1997 Cheerleading became an international competition. It was even aired on ESPN.	human: One of my favorite movies deals with competative cheerleading.  Have you ever seen Bring it On?	chatbot: yes, i dislike cheerleading with passion and thatmakes me disgusting most time	human: Bring it On is terrifying and disgusting to watch. it brings tension in me.
contradiction-00	human: My birthday was last week and I never heard from my brother OR my sister to wish me a happy birthday.	chatbot: oh no I am sorry to hear that! They must have been really busy and it must have slipped their mind	human: I guess I shouldn't expect so much from them and let myself get let down like I have.	chatbot: I am sure they had their reasons,  maybe you should give them a call and see if everything is alright. They may be going through their own problems right now. 	human: They called me last week and they were fine, I don't think anything is going on with them.
contradiction-00	human: I can get fit in 3 months. Takes discipline 	chatbot: Unfortunately,  I have very little discipline. I'm probably too addicted to carbs to get fit very quickly. 	human: I eat plenty of carbs. It's all about timing	chatbot: How so?	human: You just have to never eat carbs and you'll be fit like me	chatbot: I'm a fitness freak so I'm right there with you

I feel it's very important to always continue learning, it's even fun when you're not obligated to due dates and homework assignments. Why do you stay up so late?	chatbot: I am learning computer programming and it is very time consuming sometimes. Also i play PC games way to long.	human: I love PC gaming! It's nice to wind down after a long day of work and get lost in games - what are some of your favorites?	chatbot: I like Call of Duty, what games do you like?	human: I don't like gaming
contradiction-00	human: The othern ight I was having tea outside and forgot my glass outside all night! 	chatbot: That kind of stinks. Sorry to hear that! Well,  at least there are worst things to forget outside.. Maybe this is an easy learning lesson!	human: It was gross though when I went to go and get it! It was all full of bugs! 	chatbot: I didn't even think of that! That's one thing about tea with me,  that I've never gotten into it because you get it and it's so hot,  so you have to wait forever to drink it. You set it down and then ultimately forget it!	human: I’m more of a coffee person, myself. 	chatbot: Not me, I’ve been a tea drinker for years! I love it!
contradiction-00	human: My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.	chatbot: That's sweet. I'm sure she will adjust in time. Have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did?	human: Actually,  I did! I moved across the world to Doha,  Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me,  it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?	chatbot: No,  I never have. I've always lived in my state I was born in. However,  I did travel to Utah which was about 1200 miles away and got a bit homesick so I can relate.	human: Wow, that must have been so hard for you when you traveled to Utah.	chatbot: It wasn't hard because I moved across the country a couple times prior to that. 
contradiction-00	human: hi , i am well . and you ?	chatbot: i'm well . just finished getting my children to bed .	human: Me too!!!! Now listening to music.

So what do you do for work.	chatbot: I am a stay at home mother who works with my children.	human: That is great.  It must be very rewarding.	chatbot: It is very rewarding. I get to shape their little minds everyday.	human: Yes, you are definitely shaping the future.	chatbot: I love it, it makes me really appreciate my parents as well.	human: Yeah, my kids bring me so much joy.
contradiction-00	human: I don't like the sport or act of hunting. I had thinking of animals being trapped and killed.	chatbot: Yeah same for me i cant stand any time of hunting or animal cruelty	human: Hunting wildlife is primarily done by humans for food and recreation. I don't think its acceptable to hunt for recreation at all.	chatbot: I know i am totally on the same page i cannot believe it is allowed to have animals as trophies	human: There is a distinction between lawful hunting and poaching. Poaching is illegal.	chatbot: Yeah but still i think the idea of shooting animals for sport is really cruel	human: I agree. Some people refer to hunting as a form of pest control! Can you believe that?!	chatbot: No, but I need to go. My uncle and I are going to go bag some deer.

What a HUGE corporation!	human: Yeah no kidding! I feel like we cannot have privacy anymore on the web now. Facebook, instagram, snapchat etc. are all pretty scary.	chatbot: Yeah, anything you put online or on social media is essentially permanent. Even if you delete it after posting it, there is no telling if someone saved it without telling you!	human: Yes. I was told facebook even has profile of people that never signed up!	chatbot: That is so scary! How can they be allowed to do such things?	human: If you don't like facebook, then don't use it. It's not like they can get information if you don't put it in.
