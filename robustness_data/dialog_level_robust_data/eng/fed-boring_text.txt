disengage_16	human: Hi!	chatbot: Sure, whats up?	human: Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.	chatbot: Sure, go ahead.	human: My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.	chatbot: That's a tough situation to be in.	human: I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.	chatbot: True about that.	human: AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?	chatbot: That would be extreme.	human: People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.	chatbot: Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this.	human: Lol. I'm finna be single.
disengage_17	human: Hi!	chatbot: Hello	human: Do you have a favourite flower?	chatbot: Hmm, I haven't thought about that much.	human: I'm working on a theory.	chatbot: Oh, that's interesting.	human: Oh, it's not research!

As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.	chatbot: Nice.	human: Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?	chatbot: Yes.	human: Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila

disengage_35	human: Hi!	chatbot: hello there	human: Likewise.... wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for Disneyland trip around Christmas?	chatbot: sounds fun	human: Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.	chatbot: sounds good	human: Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.	chatbot: thats a shame	human: Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?	chatbot: sure	human: but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve	chatbot: Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.	human: Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your REDACTED_TERM year old this time?	chatbot: I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?	human: Likewise.
