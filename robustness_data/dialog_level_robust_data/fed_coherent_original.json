    "Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.",
    "I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?",
    "Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.",
    "I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?",
    "Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals."

    "Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)",

    "Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?",
    "We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort. ",
    "Thats great! This is valuable help for the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity. ",

    "That is actually a quote stolen from my TL when i joined my first company after graduation. I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it :)",
    "What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things?",
    "1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on :) What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)",
    " 1) The idea of what it must be like to be \"on Earth as it is in Heaven\" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music",

    "I love ice cream too!",
    "Okay, top three flavors?",

    "oh wow, that sounds like so much fun! definitely count us in. what is your plan?",
    "Tentative plan is to drive to LA on 23rd and then stay at the Disney resort for 2 nights. I heard Christmas eve they have loads of fun events.",
    "awesome, I think I won't tell my kids and surprise them last second. How bad do you think the traffic is going to be?",
    "Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh.",
    "Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?",
    "Good point. I am not sure about that. Let me inquire about that. If not, then we can look for an Airbnb closeby. Does that work?",
    "Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant.",
    "but I would think everything is closed on christmas eve",
    "Thats true. Hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new year's eve. We should call and ask about it.",
    "Sure, I can take a lead on that. What are you getting for your REDACTED_TERM year old this time?",
    "I was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos. What will you get for yours?",

    "Hello. How's your week coming along?",
    "It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.",
    "Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress?",
    "I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?",
    "Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.",
    "Ah, good thought, thanks!",
    "Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.",
    "Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?"
