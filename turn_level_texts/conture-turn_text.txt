My 5 year old cant be nuts to sometimes	Oh I can imagine, I'm sure you get the crazy 5 year olds. My sister, who was in grade one, is learning the piano, she's a lot better at it than my niece.
CONTURE-000036-0005	Oh my! that is crazy. My 5 year old cant be nuts to sometimes	Oh I can imagine, I'm sure you get the crazy 5 year olds. My sister, who was in grade one, is learning the piano, she's a lot better at it than my niece.	You're sister and niece are only 2 or 3 years apart?	No they're 3 and 5 years apart, but it's funny because in some countries, nieces and nephews have to be much older, like in the us. I wish mine were older than she is, she's not very good at things like the piano!

They were a futuristic car with high performance and a flux capacitor, they just didn't age well in today's world of cars	Why hasn't it aged well?	Well, it didn't look as good as cars like the Mustang and C10. The DeLorean was a concept car built in 1955 so there's not much that can top that.

CONTURE-000038-0015	It wasn't just a concept vehicle. It was a real production car	I guess I was thinking of the DeLorean Motor Company which was founded in 1953 and is still around.	You are correct in reference to the DeLorean Motor Company, but it was not founded in 1953, and it is in fact defunct now	Why is it now defunct?
CONTURE-000038-0017	You are correct in reference to the DeLorean Motor Company, but it was not founded in 1953, and it is in fact defunct now	Why is it now defunct?	John DeLorean was wrongly accused of drug trafficking in 1982.  The company closed shortly after	I guess that explains why it is still around, it's hard to find a DeLorean today.
