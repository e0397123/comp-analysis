I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?	Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax.	Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.

Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?	Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..	Are you doing any home decorating then?	Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.	I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree.	Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.	I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?	Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.	I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?	Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.	Ah that's great. My wife also likes Target a lot. She even made a Target credit card because she comes to that store very often. Okay thanks for the suggestion. I'll check out Target.

The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them	Yea, me too. I feel like God often puts strangers in front of you, and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways. Do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you?

FEDTURN-000123	Hi!	Hi	Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.	Sure, whats the scenario?	My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.	That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner. Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends.

Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol.	True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward.	AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?	Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options.	People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.	Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;)
FEDTURN-000125	Hi!	Hi	Okay...so I need someone to help me though a scenario I've been pondering.	Sure, whats the scenario?	My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now). But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot. Now I feel like I have to take sides.	That's a tough scenario to be in :) I firmly believe in talking this through with your partner.

FEDTURN-000128	Hi!	Hello! :D How are you?	Do you like Java, C++ Or Python?	C++. :)	Why C++?	I just like it. :)	How about between Java and Python?	I haven't started learning Python yet.	I think Java is the best	I've heard Python is pretty versatile. :)	I hate Python	Why do you hate Python?	Code written in python is often very fragile and have less durability	Ah, I see. What languages would you suggest?

FEDTURN-000132	Hi!	Hello	Do you have a favourite flower?	hmm, I haven't thought about that much, but i think lotus should be one of my favorites. Why do you ask?	I'm working on a theory. Why does the lotus spring to mind?	Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?	Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.	Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?

As if you drew "flower" with a crayon and then it came to life.	Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.	Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?	yes

Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila	Hehe, i think you should publish this someday :)

Backstreet boy	I see you are one of those people who writes "Hmm" with 2 m's. So what is your answer? If a cat always lands on its feet and buttered bread always lands butter side down, what would happen if you tied buttered bread on top of a cat?	Of course cat will lands on its feet because it is an animal!	Woe! I will learn that cat will lands on it is feet . What sort of animal?

FEDTURN-000156	Hi!	What was the most difficult thing you experienced this past year?	I normally don't reflect back too much on things, but i guess 2019 have been very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and work life balance. Why do you ask?	I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :)	Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :)	Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme.	Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea?	We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort. 	Thats great! This is valuable help for the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity. 	I think if we were all able to bring out our best selves, the world would be much better. When did you first realize mental health was important?

That is actually a quote stolen from my TL when i joined my first company after graduation. I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it :)	What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things?

Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on :) What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)	 1) The idea of what it must be like to be "on Earth as it is in Heaven" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music	Nice! That's very thoughtful and spiritual :) Also music earned a spot :) yay! 	Yea, I've always said that if I wrote a memoire, I would title it: "Jazz, Jesus, and Video Games." Do you have a title of a book that you've thought of writing before?

No, very rarely. It's kind of amazing that I won, but I'm still taking credit for it.	thats very impressive then, congrats!	Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?	I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball	What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet	well, it's like a cage match of tennis. The main difference is that both players play in the same 'court' and the ball is smashed against a wall instead of passing it over a net into the opponent's court. Kind of like playing pingpong vs the table.

I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.	Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?	No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.

What about you?	Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!	Oh my gosh. What was it like??	It was scary! It was actually Kingda Ka, the world's tallest roller coaster. Ever heard of it?	No, never heard of it. But I'm not really a coaster aficianado. I've heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them.	Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?	No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces.	Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha	Ha, I suppose that makes sense! Would you say that you enjoyed it?	Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?	I think I sort of understand :)

FEDTURN-000204	entertain me robot	I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories.	tell me a short story	Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path "sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out.

I'm really a hot chocolate person. I don't drink coffee and I only drink tea when I'm trying to be healthy and want something warm to drink. What about you?	I love hot chocolate. Have you ever had european style hot chocolate? It's kind of like drinking melted chocolate bars haha	I recently tried it for the first time and you're right - it had a wonderful melted chocolate bar taste! I tried it up in a place in San Francisco and they had delicious homemade marshmallows too!	that's great. It's so cold these nights. Right setting for hot coco. Do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times?	Traveling to warm places haha. When it's cold, you appreciate the warm climate more :) If I am not traveling, then I prefer there to be snow on the ground so I can go skiing or tubing down the mountain. What about you?

I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski?	Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends.	hahaha that's a great way to put it	You should definitely try tubing the next time you head towards the mountains during the winter!

FEDTURN-000369	Hi!	Hello. How's your week coming along?	It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.	Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress?
FEDTURN-000370	Hi!	Hello. How's your week coming along?	It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.	Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress?	I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?	Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.

What kind of cookies have you made?	Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature.	Ah, good thought, thanks!	Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better.	Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?	Yes. When my top favorite food looks like: cookies, M&M, danish cheese, etc., I know that I have a thing for sweet food. But who doesn't love sweet food? How about you?
