MPATHYGRADE-000149	I had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the store today. There was only one poor cashier working.	That must of been a pain! I hate waiting in lines for cashiers, they are so slow sometimes.	oh thats cool
MPATHYGRADE-000150	Someone let me cut in line at the store so I could check out faster.	wow that was really nice of them	oh well you lived through it!
MPATHYGRADE-000151	My sunday was great. All my chores were done ahead of time. It was a rare and welcomed day.	that is awesome. sundays are usually my veg out days.	When is it?
MPATHYGRADE-000152	Well, it takes perseverance and a bit of luck, but you can do it!	My dream job is being born rich. Its too late for that	Yes, and you will succeed eventually.
MPATHYGRADE-000153	I always feel like no one hears me. Like When I speak it falls on deaf ears.	That sucks. Maybe it's time to get new friends?	Glad you had fun. What breed is it?
MPATHYGRADE-000154	As I look at my 21 year old son, I often reflect on when he was smaller. Time really flies!	Time sure does fly and change is inevitable	your husband is a lucky guy!

MPATHYGRADE-000157	A year ago, I found an injured baby kitten in the road while driving.	Oh no! Did you take the kitten to an animal hospital or care for it yourself?	That's very kind of you. Too often people neglect stray animals and they suffer terrible short lives.
MPATHYGRADE-000158	Omg! That is terrible. They should really be considerate of people's time	I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing	I hope you keep it forever.
MPATHYGRADE-000159	I was planning my wedding and trying to get a caterer.  The one we were looking at was completely ignoring every time my wife tried to communicate with them, to the point where I told them off and went with someone else.

MPATHYGRADE-000160	I've been training a new girl at work this week!	How is she doing	That is awesome, good luck
MPATHYGRADE-000161	It is a blessing and curse. When I am having problems I think about what she would say to me.	That's a good way to remember her and keep her close to your heart.	She is probably working hard to provide a better life for the family.
MPATHYGRADE-000162	My husband might loose his job, I'm not sure what we will do if he does.	That is terrible. Why do you think that he will lose his job?	What kind of job is it?   I will keep my fingers crossed he gets it!

I love to see all the pictures, and think back to how little mine used to be.	I have those kinds of feelings as well. I think memories are a good thing though
MPATHYGRADE-000172	First day of school I remember ,my kids first day of school, how did it make you feel?	It just gave me the feeling that time flies by too quickly sometimes.  My youngest in the pic was in first grade and his older sister was in 7th grade.	That's awesome. That's a good amount for a little effort which is always nice.
MPATHYGRADE-000173	I love teaching people how to skydive - it is so much fun helping them to learn.	That's sound like a lot of fun! Do you know where I can go get lessons?	It does just bring about a great feeling doesn't it?
MPATHYGRADE-000174	Yes, I think they offer a great bridge to the past. Do you?	Absolutely. I love to hear my mámá tell me stories from her childhood trapping nutria and trawling with her family.	well, as long as you're happy
MPATHYGRADE-000175	I worked hard all night for that exam. it takes 5 months to get the results back. the wait is killing me	I hope you did well on it.	That is the confidence to have!
MPATHYGRADE-000176	I have a wonderful sister-in-law.  who is always there for me when I need her	That must be comforting!  It is good to have people in your life that are supportive.	Oh, that does not seem very nice.
MPATHYGRADE-000177	Oh man! What happened to your hip?	I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!	Sounds cool! There isn't anything like that around here.
MPATHYGRADE-000178	My husband is on the road a lot, I hardley ever see him.	I'm sorry. My wife could sympathize with you since I'm gone a lot on business as well.	it is so nice to see a marriage as strong these days!

MPATHYGRADE-000180	We ate good food, drank wine and went swimming.	That sounds fun.  Was the weather nice?	I bet so. I've never done anything like that before.
MPATHYGRADE-000181	I came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!	How did he scare you?	That's so sweet!  I bet he is an awesome dad!
MPATHYGRADE-000182	Thats sad. Have you been to Scotand since?	Only for funerals, unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life, I'm afraid.	don't feel sad,day will pass and present is the best moment and live
MPATHYGRADE-000183	Sounds like fund, you must be excited!	I am, I have been watching all my favorite movies.	me too, i use it for work , to relax and play games or watch movies on it
MPATHYGRADE-000184	I recently had a shop fix my car. They worked so fast!	That's good, did you have to wait there or were you able to go home?	Oh sorry to hear that.. Don't you like florida?

MPATHYGRADE-000188	When I do things that are challenging I feel more self-reliant. I recently tried taking an ice bath	Oh man! thats impressive, those baths are rough.	Sounds like somebody needs an accountabili-buddy...
MPATHYGRADE-000189	My aggressive pet rat attacked the baby rat and left her a horrible gash on her abdomen!	Wow, that sounds very disgusting.	sounds like a good idea i hope her pain goes away asap!
MPATHYGRADE-000190	I just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time. I've found my perfect restaurant/store and spent a very happy 40 mins or so wandering around it.	That's great! Did you get anything you are especially excited about? It's a restaurant and a store?	Ford makes some pretty nifty cars! I have a Ford Focus myself. Not much, but it has killer gas mileage.
MPATHYGRADE-000191	I still live and work in the place where I grew up, but all of my friends have moved away.	Aw, that has to be tough not to see your friends. Do they visit often?	I have a friend like that. We lose touch but we will always be great friends.
MPATHYGRADE-000192	My parents gave me a car for graduating from college. It makes my life so much easier.	You deserved for graduating.	Good for you. Many are getting into car loan and struggling with car payments
MPATHYGRADE-000193	My birthday was last week and I never heard from my brother OR my sister to wish me a happy birthday.	oh no I am sorry to hear that! They must have been really busy and it must have slipped their mind	wow thats a nice little drive!
MPATHYGRADE-000194	Needing some extra money, I used the spare change in my car to buy a scratch off ticket.	Nice.. what type of ticket.. Monopoly?  Price is Right?  Scrabble?  Bingo?	Smart move!  Good for you for deciding to use it responsibly.
MPATHYGRADE-000195	I woke up and the first thing I saw that my cat had decided to play with my shoes and ruin them!	Oh my, you must have been annoyed with your cat. I guess he just wanted your attention.	well , glad it wasn't something important. it was just a cat. and you are safe. so that is great!
MPATHYGRADE-000196	No, I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him, I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.	Maybe you should let him get a couple of things to make up for it.	Oh, well hopefully that works. Wouldn't want you up all night!
MPATHYGRADE-000197	Yeah it really does. It's even worse to try and close those accounts!	They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.	yea that sucks.. feeling those cars zoom by you
MPATHYGRADE-000198	I'm eating a lot of food to make sure I can lift more weight in the gym next time!	Are you taking protein?	Wow!  That is impressive!  You must be really prod of yourself!

MPATHYGRADE-000204	I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.	Did it go your way?	Wow, that's some high praise, I might just have to try it out myself!
MPATHYGRADE-000205	So who annoyed you?	A guy budged in front of some other people, I confronted him about it, and we got into an extremely heated exchange.	That is so sweet of him, those are the people we need more of in the world
MPATHYGRADE-000206	there is nothing i hate more than losing in something	Yeah, that's never fun. Did you lose at something recently?	That is the illusion of winning when in reality you are expected to lose
MPATHYGRADE-000207	My son was just born, my first boy after 11 girls!	Thats amazing, congratulations. 12 Kids your amazing.	Amazing! Congratulations. When so many children have issues, it is always great to see one that is healthy and well.
MPATHYGRADE-000208	If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!	I know the feeling.	I do hate flooding as well
MPATHYGRADE-000209	I feel nostalgic when playing old school games with my bro	Nice, me too, are you playing Nintendo games?	I don't know much about video games but remember playing Mario and games on a Nintendo 64.
MPATHYGRADE-000210	I agree, the writing part is easy part, but the speaking part is the worst!	Yeah, it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience	Yes! life is a blessing, and we need to make the most of every day.

MPATHYGRADE-000218	I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.	I'm sorry to hear that! How did you find out?	Wow...You need to find a new place to live because that's completely unreasonable.
MPATHYGRADE-000219	My sister threw up the other day and made a huge mess.	that must have been an explosion and a half, did  you clean it up?	Wow! That is really impressive!
MPATHYGRADE-000220	Over the summer my family went to Alabama to visit family and I felt a lot of emotions	I guess you don't live in Alabama? Was it overall a good trip....or challenging? Or both!	Oh, sometimes you just have to accept weather changing your plans. I am sure you can go another time.

MPATHYGRADE-000222	I hope she hears some good news. Is it pretty serious?	She had stage 3 cancer, but she was clear last screening a year ago.	I hope she was able to fend for herself. I'm sorry she went through that loss.
MPATHYGRADE-000223	I just bought iced coffee yesterday and my brother drank the rest of it without asking me.	Wow. Does he usually do stuff like that?	I know that feeling but I crashed my car my dad bought for me like 1 year later. But that feeling of happiness was awesome!
MPATHYGRADE-000224	Last night I was walking home from work in a bad part of town, I was a bit scared.	You should have taken a Uber. You never know what will happen these days.	Was the drive a necessary one to take?
MPATHYGRADE-000225	I drank a lot of alcohol at my friend's BBQ party, and I ended up puking and passing out. Not my finest moment.	Haha, I can relate to that. I did that too, and my friends took a wonderful photo of it. They like to stick it on our yearly Christmas cards to each other	I am such a lucky guy to have a friend like you
MPATHYGRADE-000226	I'm looking forward to my best friend's surprise birthday party next week!	That sounds like so much fun! I love parties!	Parties are so much fun! Are you celebrating anything special, or is the party just a get together?
MPATHYGRADE-000227	Ugh! I hate it when stuff like that happens. Were you able to get a refund on your tickets?	No. We went ahead and went on. It actually turned out to be a great trip with zero incidents.	It's awful when you spend money on tickets and popcorn and it's a bad time. Did they put all of the best moments in the trailer?
MPATHYGRADE-000228	Last year I made a bet with my friend and he lost, so he had to buy me a Nintendo Switch. I was so great.	That's quite the win! What was the bet?	Wow I love nintendo, you should get an NES classic!

MPATHYGRADE-000231	Once I was suppose to go visit my sister and nieces who I hadn't seen in forever but I ended up breaking my heal and big toe and wasn't able to go. I was so upset!

MPATHYGRADE-000232	One night when my children and I came home, I saw a shadow inside! I was so fearful and afraid!	Oh that can be scary. I don't watch horror movies because I know that I'll do just that!	Thank goodness! Yeah, I only watch scary movies in the daytime!
MPATHYGRADE-000233	I went to the beach other day	That is really cool . Did you have a good time?	oh, did you enjoy it? I love going to the beach
MPATHYGRADE-000234	I had a high risk pregnancy up until a few months ago. I felt the most grateful I'd ever been when my baby turned out healthy.	Congrats, that must have been a very stressful time leading up the the birth.	That's an amazing feat. Studying is kind of a chore for me.
MPATHYGRADE-000235	Tomorrow is the big day, I have to deliver my proposal to the client.	Are you ready for it?	Wow, good luck.  I hope it all goes well. It sounds like you're confident that it will. Have you done one before?
MPATHYGRADE-000236	I was feeling kind of down so I ended up snuggling with a stuffed rabbit I have. It brought back a lot of good old memories.	Never too old or too manly to snuggle a stuffed animal. My mom said I used to carry this blanket with me when I was a toddler, everywhere I went. I wish I still had it. If I did, I'd consider using it again, or at the very least passing it down to my own kid. What's the harm, you know? If something gives you comfort and doesn't bother anyone else, there should be no shame.	Same I've put my parents through a lot.  But now I'm trying to be the best version of myself so I can eventually pay them back

MPATHYGRADE-000238	When I got the phone call that my mom had cancer I was so upset.	I am so sorry to hear that. No one should have to go through something like that.	Then maybe you should think about trying to find a job somewhere else?
MPATHYGRADE-000239	I was very sad when I found out that my neighbors houses were going to be demolished because the city ordered it..	Is the city going to build them new ones at least?	It is unbelievable to meet these wild animals in a city. You should definitely call them

MPATHYGRADE-000241	Honestly? I have a pretty special nephew. He just solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness Millenium Prize problem.	Holy moses, he must be as smart as me. I solved that thing in five minutes last week. Child's play.	If you live under his roof then you should obey him.

MPATHYGRADE-000251	I understand, but coming at me head on, on a two lane highway, while I'm on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool.	I cant imagine how scared you must have been.	i enjoy a little rain every once in a while, but i dont like thunderstorms either

MPATHYGRADE-000256	One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at, my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.

MPATHYGRADE-000263	I'm gonna take the family out to the lake this weekend, we might rent a boat.	That sounds like a great way to spend the weekend.  What type of boat are you thinking about renting?	Is there anything else you do besides work? A hobby you enjoy, video games, music, working out?
MPATHYGRADE-000264	I felt sooooo nervous going to my last job interview! Nerves must occur in proportion to how badly you *want* something!	I know what you mean. Did you get the job?	Good job, keep on moving up!
MPATHYGRADE-000265	Wow, that is sweet of him, does he have a crush on you?	It was a nice gesture on his part. But I do not know	Yeah, that is a good thing he found it and not someone else. What are the odds.

Its so nice to be able to do laundry and things on my breaks.  Im so productive around the house	I hope it was a good day for you, atleast you did something productive and got some laundry done haha
MPATHYGRADE-000271	A good friend of mine moved away recently and we lost contact. I really wish we would still speak.	I know how that feels. Maybe try reaching out.	I understand it is usually hard moving to a new city leaving some many people and placed behind

It's nice of you to put yourself in their shoes.
MPATHYGRADE-000274	They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!	Oh, that's not right. I have a rescue dog, she had a litter of puppies at a puppy mill before she was a year.	Perhaps she had an upset tummy or something.  Sometimes with dogs it's hard to tell.
MPATHYGRADE-000275	I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.

MPATHYGRADE-000276	I'm pretty excited for the upcoming Halloween season.	I am too! What are your plans?	Hiking and kayaking? Wow! Better pack some trail mix.
MPATHYGRADE-000277	Not until about 8am, but it's so loud I can hear it in my first floor apartment with the doors and windows closed. Idiot man!	So inconsiderate! It reminds me of my neighbours doing building work one morning at 6AM!	Maybe you should child proof the house.
MPATHYGRADE-000278	So I asked out a girl in my class and she said yes. Was a big morale boost.	im glad to hear that!	Thats good! I would of been anxious to get out of that place if that happend.

MPATHYGRADE-000280	My partner left me the other day.	That's rough, I'm sorry to hear that	Being a punching bag in a relationship is no good. It's a 2 way street. Is your partner doing their part?
MPATHYGRADE-000281	I told a lie to my mother.	Was it a bad one? And did she find out?	Was she mad at you?
MPATHYGRADE-000282	I feel the same way.	How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!	I am too.  I don't go out much so maybe you should make sure you do that
MPATHYGRADE-000283	I was annoyed when my favorite show wasn't on	what did you end up watching instead	Well thats disappointing. Maybe you can find a show similar to it to watch.

MPATHYGRADE-000287	I was heartbroken when my mom told me that my childhood dog had died	Oh god.. sorry.. How are you holding up?	Aw I am so sorry to hear of your dogs passing. It's hard to lose a pet. We just lost our cat this year.

MPATHYGRADE-000296	No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it, my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!	Well, did you eat her ice cream?	Wow, that is really thoughtful.
MPATHYGRADE-000297	I tripped and fell in front of some people.	Ouch! Was it a serious fall?	Oh my god, I would have been so embarrassed! How'd you react?
MPATHYGRADE-000298	Are you cleaning out a house or do you not have garbage pick-up?	The company in my city just quit picking up for any of the residents, so the dump has a line every day.	That too bad. They are other work from home opportunities though.
MPATHYGRADE-000299	I had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the store today. There was only one poor cashier working.	That must of been a pain! I hate waiting in lines for cashiers, they are so slow sometimes.	That sounds pretty healthy.  Have you always been this health conscious
