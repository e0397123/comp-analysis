My sister, who was in grade one, is learning the piano, she's a lot better at it than my niece.	User: You're sister and niece are only 2 or 3 years apart?	Chatbot: No they're 3 and 5 years apart, but it's funny because in some countries, nieces and nephews have to be much older, like in the us. I wish mine were older than she is, she's not very good at things like the piano!	User: I think I need coffee for this crazy day.	Chatbot: I can totally understand why you'd be confused about my niece and nephew being so close in age. They're like half a year apart, but I guess the rule applies differently elsewhere. I think you should go for a coffee anyway!	User: I can just make a coffee here at home lol 	Chatbot: That's always an option too, I guess. My nephew likes to make coffee with hot milk, so I don't even like making that kind. Coffee is good, though.
